# whack-a-mole
A game based upon JavaScript 


a simple grid-based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The player needs to hit the grid with the mole in as many times as possible until the time runs out.I have put the timer to be 60 seconds, and didn't added any delays.

the major things I used are:
- document.querySelector
- textContent
- forEach
- addEventListener
- setInterval
- classList.add

...and many more inbuilt JavaScript functions.
